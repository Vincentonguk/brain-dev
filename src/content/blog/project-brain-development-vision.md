## Vision
Project Brain Development explores speculative and emerging approaches to **brain–machine interaction**, kinetic-energy sensing, and secure AI.  
Goal: enable safe, consent-driven interfaces that help people **learn faster, solve problems**, and automate tasks.

## Ethics & Individual Rights
- **Privacy by design** and **data minimization**.  
- Transparent consent with **audit trails**; user can revoke at any time.  
- Strong authentication: **DNA + kinetic-presence** verification.  
- Regional compliance (e.g., GDPR-aligned policies).

## Technical Architecture (high-level)
- **Sensor Layer** — kinetic energy transmitter/receiver to establish a trusted session and seed keys.  
- **Identity & Access** — DNA-linked identity → short-lived, scoped tokens (least privilege).  
- **Cloud & Data** — encrypted domains; zero-knowledge-style access where feasible.  
- **Secure Prompt** — a command “transmission prompt” that executes actions in a sandbox with owner-only authorization.

## Practical Applications
- **Education**: skill acceleration, adaptive tutoring.  
- **Healthcare**: diagnostics support, cognitive rehab aids.  
- **RPA**: observe → learn → automate repetitive workflows with human oversight.  
- **Digital Services**: email, contacts, payments via strictly scoped integrations.

## Roadmap
1. **Phase 1 — Sensor Prototype**: acquire and validate signals from kinetic sensors.  
2. **Phase 2 — Identity & Policy**: DNA link, consent, and access control.  
3. **Phase 3 — Secure Prompt**: sandboxed executor with least-privilege.  
4. **Phase 4 — Integrations**: email/contacts/payments.  
5. **Phase 5 — Trials**: limited pilots, safety & UX iteration.
