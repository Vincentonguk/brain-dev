## Vision
Project Brain Development explores speculative and emerging approaches to **brain–machine interaction**, kinetic-energy sensing, and secure AI.
Goal: enable safe, consent-driven interfaces that help people **learn faster, solve problems**, and automate tasks.

## Ethics & Individual Rights
- **Privacy by design** and **data minimization**.
- Transparent consent with **audit trails**; user can revoke at any time.
- Strong authentication: **DNA + kinetic-presence** verification.
- Regional compliance (e.g., GDPR-aligned policies).

## Technical Architecture
- **Sensor Layer** — kinetic transmitter/receiver for trusted sessions.
- **Identity & Access** — DNA-linked identity → short-lived tokens.
- **Cloud & Data** — encrypted domains; zero-knowledge style where feasible.
- **Secure Prompt** — sandboxed executor with owner-only authorization.

## Roadmap
1. Sensor Prototype  2. Identity & Policy  3. Secure Prompt
4. Integrations      5. Trials
